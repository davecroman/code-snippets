## What is this?

We know the concept. We know the algorithm. But every tool, language, and framework does it in a slightly different way. Those subtleties aren't always clear, and we can't always pull them straight out of our head.

Sometimes, we need a quick reference. Sometimes, we need to just get things done. Sometimes, some of us need are better off with order in a world of chaos.

Hence, this collection of snippets.
