## What is this?

I know the concept. I know the algorithm. But every tool, language, and framework does it in a slightly different way. Those subtleties aren't always clear. I'm not a superhero; I'm not a genius. I can't always pull them straight out of my head.

Sometimes, I need a quick reference. Sometimes, I need to just get things done. Sometimes, I'm better off with a bit of order in a world of chaos.

Hence this collection of snippets.
